          <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
          <p>
            In the midst of the mundane and the procrastination-laden days of my
            final exams in 2022, I stumbled upon the inception of a story born
            out of sheer boredom. It began as a whimsical distraction, but as
            the exam chaos subsided, so did my initial efforts, leaving only the
            fledgling first two parts in its wake.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, as the calendar flipped to April 2023, the embers of creativity
            reignited, breathing life into what I now consider the crux of the
            narrative—Part 3. This digital rebirth not only marks the
            continuation of Yuta Tokito's journey but also serves as a testament
            to my evolving drawing skills and storytelling prowess, a
            metamorphosis documented in the "Draft Story."
          </p>
          <p>
            This digital adaptation is more than just pixels on a screen; it's
            an invitation for everyone to partake in the evolving tapestry of
            this tale. A fusion of influences from beloved animanga like Attack
            on Titan, Bleach, Jujutsu Kaisen, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, and
            more, the story weaves these inspirations into a unique fabric that
            I hope resonates with readers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Centered around our protagonist, Yuta Tokito (formerly known as
            "Kujo Jotaro" in the draft), the narrative embarks on a journey of
            revenge and redemption. Yuta's quest to avenge his fallen family
            members unfolds against the backdrop of a sinister corporation, the
            nucleus of the antagonist's organization. Along the way, Yuta finds
            companions whose camaraderie and support become pivotal in his
            pursuit of justice.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the story unfolds digitally, it invites you to join Yuta Tokito
            on his odyssey—a tale born of procrastination, inspired by animanga,
            and crafted with the hope that its essence resonates with the hearts
            of those who embark on this adventure.
